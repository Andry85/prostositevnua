"Simple-C" is a plugin for the GetSimple CMS system that allows for the
insertion of customized contact forms into the articles.

IMPORTANT: This is likely to be the last version of this fork, as I'm going to 
collaborate with Nicolas Liautaud on the evolution of his p01-contact plugin, 
which will likely be named FormSimple. Stay tuned!

- Installation
As with any other regular GetSimple plugin, you only have to unzip the files
into the plugins folder of GetSimple, getting a structure like this:

plugins/
      + simple-c.php
      + simple-c/
                      + simple-c-functions.php
                      + (other php and txt files)
                      + lang/
                            + en_US.php
                            + (other php files)
...and so forth.

Once you have copied the files in the above position, you only have to activate
the plugin from within the administrative interface and move from there on, as
you will be able to get to the latest version of this plugin, as well to the
documentation links and so forth.

For any problem, curiosity or request about this plugin please refer to me,
