IMPORTANT: This is likely to be the last version of this plugin, as I'm going to 
collaborate with Nicolas Liautaud on the evolution of his p01-contact plugin, 
which will likely be named FormSimple. Stay tuned!
================================================================================

Many thanks to Nicolas Liautaud <contact@nliautaud.fr> for creating p01-contact,
(a plugin for the GetSimple CMS system), which I forked to create this plugin,
named simple-contact: thank you Nicolas also for sharing your code under the MIT
License terms allowing me to modify it and share my modifications.

The original p01-contact contained the work of different other people who have
helped him translating the plugin into different languages. The current language
files have been already modified and will eventually be extended further on,
for that reason I dedided to move the credits here.

Credits for the original translations of p01-contact go to:
    Martin Köhler (German)
    Nicolas Liautaud (English and French)
    Carlos Navarro (Spanish)
    Nicola Sarti (Italian)
    Thomas Stolwijk (Dutch)
    Stanislav Ulver (Russian)
    Göran Söderberg (Swedish)

I will eventually add more credits here for anybody willing to help me translate
this plugin by adding new languages or completing the existing ones.

Thank you for your attention,
bests,
Francesco Simone Carta <entuland@gmail.com>
