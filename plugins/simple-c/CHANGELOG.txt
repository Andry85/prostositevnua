Version 0.0.3

- replaced "Simple Contact" and "simple-contact" everywhere to "Simple-C",
    "simple-c" and the alike, to avoid confusion with a pre-existing
    plugin already named "simple-contact". Makes no big difference under the
    light of the "FormSimple" perspective (see "CREDITS.txt"), but I wanted to 
    clear up this conflict

- moved the link to these informative files from the plugins' page to the
    bottom of the settings page to avoid unneeded clutter

- nothing really more than this, bye bye Simple-C!

Version 0.0.2:
- added appropriate links to download the latest version and get to the forum

- renamed admin_email() to simple_contact_default_email() and made unset_r()
    a member of SimpleContact to avoid conflict with any existing p01-contact 
    installation, also renamed all defined constants

Version 0.0.1:
- changed the tag intro from "contact" to "simplec" in order to avoid conflict 
    with any existing p01-contact installation

- allowed for language selection on a per-form basis using the 
    "formlang = XX" marker, where "XX" is either a 2-letter language code as
    "it" or "de", or a 5-letter language code such as "en_US" or "fr_FR";
    if "en" is used, it points to "en_US". In order for this to correctly work,
    the "formlang" parameter must be the first one right after the "simplec" tag
    intro marker.

- the default form settings now get appended to the per-form settings, whereas
    the original version completely replaced the default form settings with
    the per-form settings, where specified

- fixed admin_email() function to retrieve data from GSUSERSPATH instead of 
    GSDATAOTHERPATH

- added .htaccess in /simple-contact as per plugin development guidelines

- several code conversions (mainly, all conditionals and loops now use brackets,
     even if the are one-liners)

- reformatted the whole code to fit to my customs (the first bracket does not 
    take a line on its own any more and indent is now 2 spaces instead of 4)

- added this changelog.txt file

- added the credits.txt file

- added the license.txt file

- added the readme.txt file

- converted the language management as required by 
    http://get-simple.info/wiki/plugins:i18n

-- you can now use http://get-simple.info/extend/plugin/translate/112/ to 
    translate this plugin, feel free to do so and share your translations!

-- it is normal for the plugin above to find zero strings in the code as this 
    uses centralized lang() functions in the code

-- converted the lang() functions to use the builtin GetSimple i18n_r() function

-- added .htaccess in /simple-contact/lang

-- renamed the language array(s) from $p01contact_lang to $i18n

-- moved all languages' credits to the credits.txt file, since language files 
    are going to be processed by other plugins which do not support comments
